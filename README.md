üöÄ Project Overview
FinArea is an AI-powered personal finance application designed to help users understand, track, and improve their spending habits. It provides intelligent solutions for individuals who want to gain full visibility over their financial behavior and make smarter decisions about their money.
By analyzing bank statements and transaction data, FinArea automatically categorizes expenses into clear and understandable groups such as groceries, dining, subscriptions, and bills. It leverages advanced natural language processing models, including Google Gemini, OpenAI GPT-4, and DeepSeek, to interpret financial data and produce personalized budget recommendations in natural language. These insights guide users on how to better manage their money from month to month.
The main purpose of FinArea is to simplify personal budgeting by eliminating manual tracking and replacing it with intelligent automation. With FinArea, users no longer need to rely on spreadsheets or generic budget templates. Instead, they receive tailored forecasts and recommendations based on their actual spending behavior. This makes budgeting more precise, relevant, and sustainable in the long term.
FinArea is especially suitable for:
‚Ä¢	University students who want to track daily expenses and avoid overspending,
‚Ä¢	Young professionals aiming to save more efficiently,
‚Ä¢	Families who seek a consolidated view of household expenses.
What makes FinArea unique is its clean and interactive dashboard that presents visual breakdowns of spending through bar charts, pie charts, and trend graphs. Additionally, it offers the ability to set custom budget goals and receive alerts if spending exceeds those limits. The application also supports encrypted data uploads (e.g., CSV, PDF) and ensures user privacy by following best practices in data security.
In the future, FinArea aims to integrate with live banking APIs (like Plaid) to automate statement retrieval, add debt tracking, and provide investment overviews ‚Äî transforming it from a budgeting tool into a full-scale financial wellness platform.
With FinArea, personal finance becomes smarter, simpler, and more personalized than ever.

-The finarea frontend offers a user-centric interface to make personal finance management intuitive and insightful. It connects to the powerful backend API to deliver a seamless experience, allowing users to:
Register and log in securely to their personal finance dashboard.
Upload PDF bank statements for automated AI-powered analysis.
View detailed, period-based spending summaries through interactive charts and graphs.
Understand their spending habits with automatically categorized transactions.
Receive and review AI-generated budget forecasts and financial advice.
